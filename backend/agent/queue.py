"""
JobQueue owns the three queue-related hardening items from Section 3.2:

  - "A single bounded-concurrency job queue"
  - "Bounded-concurrency queue around every Part 4 (GPU) call — two
    simultaneous requests must queue, never collide"
  - "Job execution decoupled from the HTTP connection — closing the tab
    must not kill the job"
  - "try/except around every Part 3/4/5 call — one failed job must never
    take the process down"

submit() only registers a JobRecord and schedules a background asyncio task
— it never awaits the job itself, so the HTTP handler that calls it (POST
/api/query in api/main.py) returns immediately regardless of how long the
job takes or whether the client is still connected. The concurrency bound
on run_inference lives in the asyncio.Semaphore passed into Planner.execute
(see planner.py) — this class owns creating and sharing that one semaphore
across every job, which is what actually makes "two simultaneous requests
queue instead of colliding" true.

Trace-step-level failures are logged and re-raised by Trace.stage() (see
trace.py); _run() is the single place that turns an exception, wherever it
came from, into job status "failed" instead of letting it propagate into
asyncio's default (silent, process-surviving but easy to lose track of)
unhandled-task-exception handling.
